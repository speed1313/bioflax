## Introduction

Bioflax provides an unofficial JAX implementation of biologically plausible deep learning algorithms. In particular, Feedback Alignment, Kolen-Pollack, and Direct Feedback alignment are implemented and a framework for running experiments with them is given. The code implements custom [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html) modules, which flawlessly integrate with the Flax framework.

The respective algorithms' network structures are depicted in the following scheme. For a more detailed overview please refer to the [docs](/docs/README.md).

## Requirements & Installation

To run the code on your own machine, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

For the GPU installation of JAX, which is a little more involved please refer to the [JAX installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

For dataloading PyTorch is needed. It has to be installed separately and more importantly, the CPU version must be installed because of inference issues with JAX. Please refer to [PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Data Download

In this first release, the code has built-in support to run experiments on the MNIST dataset, a teacher-student dataset, and a sin-regression dataset. None of these require explicit data download. MNIST will be downloaded automatically on execution and the teacher-student dataset as well as the sin-regression dataset are created on the fly.

## Repository structure

```

## Use layers

Separately from the rest of the code, the Flax custom modules - the biological layer implementations respectively - can be used to define custom modules (Dense networks) that run with the respective deep learning algorithm. For example, a two-layer Dense network with sigmoid activation in the hidden layer that perfectly integrates with the Flax framework can be created for each of the algorithms as follows:

```python
import jax
import flax.linen as nn
from model import (
    RandomDenseLinearFA,
    RandomDenseLinearKP,
    RandomDenseLinearDFAOutput,
    RandomDenseLinearDFAHidden
)

class NetworkFA(nn.Module):
            @nn.compact
            def __call__(self, x):
                x = RandomDenseLinearFA(15)(x)
                x = nn.sigmoid(x)
                x = RandomDenseLinearFA(10)(x)
                return x

class NetworkKP(nn.Module):
            @nn.compact
            def __call__(self, x):
                x = RandomDenseLinearKP(15)(x)
                x = nn.sigmoid(x)
                x = RandomDenseLinearKP(10)(x)
                return x

# Note the differences for DFA. In particular, activations must be handed to the hidden layers and mustn't be on the
# computational path elsewhere. Secondly, the hidden layers need the final output dimension as an additional input
 class NetworkDFA(nn.Module):
            @nn.compact
            def __call__(self, x):
                x = RandomDenseLinearDFAHidden(15, 10, nn.sigmoid)(x)
                x = RandomDenseLinearDFAOutput(10)(x)
                return x

```

If you need help on how to use modules for actual learning in Flax please refer to the [Flax doxumentation](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Run experiments

To run an experiment execute

```
python run_train.py
```

which will result in a run with the default configuration. For information about the arguments and their default settings execute one of the following commands

```
python run_train.py --help
python run_train.py --h
```
